INSTALLATION

The installation of Games::Bingo has some requirements which need to be
installed also.

PDFLIB

This module requires PDFLib. PDFLib can be downloaded from
http://www.pdflib.com/ and is owned by PDFLib. The prebuilt version
apparently does not hold the Perl bindings, which leaves the unuseful
in conjunction with this project so the PDFLib has to be compiled in
order to work.

Games::Bingo::Print have only been tested with:

- PDFLib 4.0.3
  http://www.pdflib.com/pdflib/download/pdflib-4.0.3.tar.gz 
  
- PDFLib 7.0.1 on OSX
  http://www.pdflib.com/download/free-software/pdflib-lite/


NB for PDFLib 4.0.3 users on MacOSX

For OS X 10.2 users there is a patch to the configure file please see:

http://www.pdflib.com/pdflib/patches.html

However the freeware version works perfectly and it is freeware.

% ./configure

% make

% make install #might require super user privileges

PDFLib from CPAN

Apart from the installation of the PDFLib libraries you will require the
PDFLib module from CPAN, which wraps the library.

To install PDFLib from CPAN

% perl -MCPAN -e 'install Games::Bingo'

To install PDFLib from tar-ball:

% perl Makefile.PL

% make

% make install #might require super user privileges

Games::Bingo::Print

Finally you have to install Games::Bingo::Print

Games::Bingo::Print from CPAN
